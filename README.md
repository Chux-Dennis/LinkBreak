# LinkBreak

![LinkBreak Demo](./demo.png)

**_An [express](https://expressjs.com) app buiit with EJS templating,mongoose(MongoDb) database and [Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com)_** .Use LinkBreak on your local system to shorten URLS of external sites

LinkBreak was a project primarily built to shorten URLs of long sites. It was also built to test my efficinecy on interacting with databases and API routing using [Node.js](nodejs.org).

LinkBreak utilizes [MurmurHash-js](https://github.com/mikolalysenko/murmurhash-js) for **_query encryption and unique identification_** in database management

> _**NOTE:** This project requires MongoDB Driver to be installed on one's local system for its functionality , as it has no external backend connection to any cloud-hosted databse or otherwise._
